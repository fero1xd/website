Every programmer writes this at some point. Here's mine.

## Who I Am

I'm Pranjal Butola, a 19 year old computer science student and enthusiast from India. I'm entirely **self-taught** as my journey started during the COVID lockdown when I had plenty of time and a laptop. What began as curiosity turned into an obsession.

## How I Got Here

I started with **Python** and building **Discord bots**. There's something magical about writing code that actually *does* something — even if it's just a bot that responds to commands. That got me hooked.

From Discord bots, I kept learning. Frontend, Backend, databases, piece by piece, I made my way to **full-stack development**. But as I built more complex things, I started wondering: how do these systems actually *scale*? How do they handle millions of users? That's when **system design** and **DevOps** caught my attention.

I spent a lot of time studying about Containerization and Docker. AWS was also something I was really interested in, so I started learning about it.

These days, I spend my time somewhere between **backend development** and **infrastructure**. I am currently building passion projects and side projects.

## What I'm Exploring Now

I have a tendency to go down tech rabbit holes. Currently deep in:

- **[Effect.ts](https://effect.website)**: TypeScript's answer to "what if we actually handled errors properly?"
- **[Zig](https://ziglang.org)**: systems programming without the headache  
- **OpenGL & game programming**: learning the ropes from [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com)

## Beyond the Screen

When I'm not coding:

- **Gaming**: Immortal in Valorant
- **Anime**: Attack on Titan is the best anime ever.

## Real Talk

I have **zero industry experience** so far. Everything I know comes from building projects, reading documentation, and breaking things until they work. But I'm actively looking for opportunities to work with real teams and real problems. If you're hiring (or just want to chat), hit me up!

## What to Expect Here

I'll be documenting my learning journey, sharing experiments (and failures), and writing about whatever tech I'm currently interested in.

Thanks for stopping by.
